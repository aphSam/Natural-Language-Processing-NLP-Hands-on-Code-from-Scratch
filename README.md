#  Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Hands-on Code from Scratch

 This repository contains **end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) implementations** completed as part of the **CampusX NLP YouTube Playlist**.  
All concepts are implemented with a **hands-on, code-from-scratch approach**, focusing on *practical understanding rather than black-box usage*.

The repository serves as a **learning log, reference guide, and interview-ready resource** for NLP fundamentals to advanced concepts.
